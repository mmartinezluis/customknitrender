# customknitrender

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of customknitrender is to make it easy to switch between output formats for rmarkdown files when the files share the `output` yaml parameter from a single source.

## Installation

You can install the development version of customknitrender from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mmartinezluis/customknitrender")
```

## Usage

<!-- ```text -->
<!--   ProjectRoot -->
<!--   ├── Data -->
<!--   │   ├── raw_data.csv -->
<!--   │   └── clean_data.csv -->
<!--   ├── Scripts -->
<!--   │   ├── data_prep.R -->
<!--   │   └── analysis.R -->
<!--   ├── Output -->
<!--   │   └── results.html -->
<!--   └── README.md -->
<!-- ``` -->

Assume that you have a project in RStudio with the following structure:

```text
  ProjectRoot
  ├── article_1.Rmd
  ├── article_2.Rmd
  └── article_3.Rmd
```

where each article file contains the following `output` configuration (`header-includes` is extra configuration for latex/pdf output):

```yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex
    number_sections: yes
  html_document: default
  word_document: default
header-includes:
  - \usepackage{ragged2e}
  - \usepackage{indentfirst}
---
```

If you wanted all article rmarkdown files to share the same `output` rather than repeating the code within each file and, optionally, share the same `header-includes` latex configuration, you can create an `_output.yaml` file in the same directory where the rmarkdown files are, and move the `output` configurations there, and also create a `header.tex` file  and move the `header-includes` code there:

```text
  ProjectRoot
  ├── _output.yaml
  ├── article_1.Rmd
  ├── article_2.Rmd
  └── article_3.Rmd
  ├── header.tex
```

where _output.yaml is defined as

```yaml
pdf_document:
  latex_engine: xelatex
  number_sections: yes
  includes:
    in_header: header.tex
html_document:
  default
word_document:
  default
```

(notice that no top-bottom dashes are needed nor the `output` key in the yaml file), and header.tex as

```tex
\usepackage{ragged2e}
\usepackage{indentfirst}
```
(notice that no dashes are needed in the tex file).

With this, the frontmatter of the article files reduces to

```text
---

---
```

With this, all three article files contain the same configuration for pdf, html, and word document output (which is great when you need the same config). However, when you press the `Knit` button from RStudio within one of the article files, regardless of whether you press "Knit to HTML", "Knit to PDF", or "Knit to Word", the file will be knitted to PDF. This is because the Knit button runs knitr's `knit` function with the first output type written in `_output.yaml`. Hence, if you wanted to render any article file in HTML instead, you would need to move the `word_document` key to the top of the `_output.yaml` file, save the file, and then go to, say, article_1.Rmd, and knit the file. Hence, for any time you would like to switch the output format, you woud need to do an edit-save in one `_output.yaml`, and another save in your desired file. Here is where the customknitrender package comes into play. The package provides a function, `in_format(x)`, that you can use in the frontmatter of your rmarkdown files to specify the desired output format using integers.

In the frontmatter of, say, article_1.Rmd, include the `knit` key, and call the package:

```text
---
knit: !r customknitrender::in_format(3)
---
```

```{r}
library(customknitrender)
```

will render the file in pdf format. Using

```text
customknitrender::in_format(33)
```

renders the file in HTML format, and any other integer defaults to word document format.


This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(customknitrender)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
